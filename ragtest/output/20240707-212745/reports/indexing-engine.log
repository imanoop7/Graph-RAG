Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \n\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \n\nDrug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does. \n\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums.

And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. \n\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.  \n\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. \n\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. \n\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. \n\nWe’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.  \n\nWe’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \n\nAnd we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get\n######################\nOutput:'}

In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \n\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \n\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom. \n\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.  \n\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. \n\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \n\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \n\nDrug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does. \n\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent. \n\nSecond – cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.  \n\nLet’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and\n######################\nOutput:'}

Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan: \n\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \n\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \n\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom. \n\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay\n######################\nOutput:'}

"This gives talking to strangers\' a whole new meaning."\n\nAlex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."\n\nTogether, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity\'s response to a message from the heavens.
